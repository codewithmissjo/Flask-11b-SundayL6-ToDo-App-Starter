# ToDo App Project Planning

## The Phases
1. Setup the project (using the starter kit)
2. Plan and implement the database
3. Plan and implement CRUD operations:
  A. (Read) Reading ToDo Tasks
  B. (Create) Adding ToDo Tasks
  C. (Delete) Deleting ToDo Tasks
  D. (Update) Editing ToDo Tasks
4. Customization and/or Challenges

## The Starter Kit
*  How many templates are there?
*  Do any of the templates "fit" inside of other templates? Which ones?
*  Which templates include a form?
  *  In any forms, do all of the text inputs have a name attribute?
*  Which templates include an HTML table?
  *  How many columns are in the table?
*  List the Jinja2 template tags/placeholders in each template.
  *  For example: layout.html -- {{user}}

## The Database
### Planning
*  What will you name the database file?
*  What will you name the database table?
*  How many columns will you need in the database table?
  *  What are their names and what data types are they?
### Database Knowledge
*  What other code do you need to include in app.py in order to work with a database? Such as imports, connections, etc.
*  When do you need to "commit" changes to a database?
*  What character do you use within a SQLite query to represent a placeholder?
*  How many tables can you create within a single database?
